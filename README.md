Our IT2805 project
==============

This is a webpage for a shoe shop called "Egge & Young Bootmakers Inc." for the IT2805 web techonology course at NTNU.

### Libraries and frameworks

For this project we have used the frontend framework Twitter Bootstrap mainly for its grid system to get a fluid layout, and for some of its components like the buttons we use.

To make the Javascript easier to deal with we have also included the jQuery library with its powerful selectors and helpful iterators.

For typography we have used "Raleway", a delicate open font which we source from Google's webfont page.
